🚀🚀 Challenges Faced

☀️ The Main Challenge was to implement Typescript in the project.
☀️ When using Next.js for SSR, i had to make sure that the server-rendered components was type-safe, 
and data fetched on the server is properly typed this was quite hard for me in the begining.
☀️ Integrating TypeScript with state management libraries was challenging too for me.




Happy Coding ❤️
